## :fontawesome-solid-play: Introduction
ExRam.Gremlinq is a .NET object-graph-mapper (OGM) for [Apache TinkerPopâ„¢](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/)
enabled databases. An OGM on the .NET platform is for the realm of graph-databases what, 
among others, Entity Framework or NHibernate (generally called object-relational-mappers, or ORMs)
are for relational databases.

TinkerPop-enabled graph databases are queried by a graph query language called Gremlin. ExRam.Gremlinq enables
.NET developers to create and issue this kind of queries in a strongly-typed fashion by using the
powerful Gremlinq-DSL abstraction over their own model of domain entity classes (usually called POCOs). It
will serialize the query to valid Gremlin for execution on the server and deserialize the results
to the correct .NET types.

## :fontawesome-solid-rocket: Features

??? "Type safety"
    ExRam.Gremlinq queries carry and pass on full information about the query result type and its role
    (vertex, edge, scalar etc.). This minimizes the possibility of writing and executing invalid queries
    and speeds up development.

    For a simple example, let's assume the domain of a simple pet-shop with classes `Cat` and
    `Dog` that both inherit from an abstract base class `Animal`. A plain Gremlin-query asking for all
    Cats in the database named 'Poppy' would look like this:

    ```groovy
    g.V().hasLabel('Cat').has('Name', 'Poppy')
    ```

    ExRam.Gremlinq allows for issuing this query using type-safe C# language constructs over the `Cat`-class:

    ```csharp
    _g.V<Cat>().Where(cat => cat.Name == "Poppy").ToArrayAsync()
    ```

    At every step in the query, ExRam.Gremlinq is aware that it is dealing with vertices of type 
    `Cat` and, upon retrieval of results from the server, deseriailze these into instances of type `Cat`.

??? Inheritance
    ExRam.Gremlinq supports type hierarchies of vertex- and edge-types and is able to determine
    the set of valid element-label to use in the transformed query executed on the server.

    Assuming the above domain, a query for alll vertices of type `Animal` will, under the hood, 
    query for the `Cat` resp. `Dog` labels and return correct instances of either types when the query 
    returns, i.e.

    ```csharp
    _g.V<Animal>().ToArrayAsync()
    ```

    will query for vertices labelled either `Cat` or `Dog` and deserialize accordingly.
    

??? "Powerful DSL"
    The type system of ExRam.Gremlinq itself, represented as various fluent interfaces that carry result
    type information, enables developers to rapidly write correct queries.

    Again assuming the above domain, enriched with `SoldTo` and `Customer` classes that represent
    edges labelled `SoldTo` pointing from `Animals` to `Customers`, we can query for the customer that
    bought a cat named 'Poppy':

    ```csharp
    g.V<Cat>().Where(cat => cat.Name == "Poppy").Out<SoldTo>().OfType<Customer>().FirstOfDefaultAsync()
    ```

    The ExRam.Gremlinq DSL will only allow fluently using the `Out<...>` method if it knows that it's
    currently on a vertex. This avoids accidentally trying to walk edges from e.g. edges or scalar values.
    The Gremlin language by itself does not prohibit writing such queries, so that bugs could only
    be detected during integration tests or, even worse, in production.

??? Expression-parsing
    ExRam.Gremlinq is capable of recognizing a wide range of C#-expressions and generate valid Gremlin.
    This enables developers to focus on the business logic in the language they're comfortable with, instead
    of dealing directly with the Gremlin query language.

    For example, querying for all the Cats whose name starts with the letter "B", the query

    ```
    .V<Person>().Where(x => x.Name.Value.StartsWith("B")).ToArrayAsync()
    ```

    will correctly be translated into proper Gremlin syntax for execution on the server.

??? Customization
    ExRam.Gremlinq is extremely customizable, from query serialization to queey execution to result 
    deserialization. It allows custom scalar types to be registered for correct (de-)serialization
    to/from native graph types.
